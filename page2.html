    <h1>Prolonged screentime damaging your eyes? Here are essential eyecare tips to de-stress and protect your vision</h1>
 <p>Digital screens have become an indispensable part of work life, be it as inconsequential screen time for scheduling a meeting on the calendar or sitting at the desk and working on the laptop for long office hours. The strain on the eyes is undeniably unhealthy but the screens can't necessarily be eliminated with the irrefutable involvement of technology in work nowadays. The digital eye strain has serious side effects and needs to be addressed to maintain a healthy relationship with technology at work.In an interview with HT, Dr Ajay Sharma, chief medical director of Eye-Q, talked about digital eye syndrome and said, "Digital eye strain, also referred to as computer vision syndrome (CVS), is becoming increasingly common, particularly for people working from home where prolonged screen use is the norm. Research shows that over 50% of individuals who spend significant time on computers suffer from some degree of eye strain, highlighting how widespread this issue has become." Dr Sharma revealed that increased and persistent screen exposure while working, is one of the primary reasons for severe digital eye strain. This leads to accommodative stress, which occurs when the eyes are forced to focus on a screen at a set distance, for prolonged periods.</p>
