    <h1>Why physical activity in schools helps children thrive</h1>

<p>What types of physical activity benefit students? Can bringing movement and play into different academic classes help children learn? How can spaces and classes for movement be inclusive? Nina first meets Fotini Vasilopoulos, a Postdoctoral researcher at the University of Sydney in Australia. “Physical activity is important for physical health, for mental health, and it also can drive behaviours for learning.” Fotini suggests giving children different types of experiences – not just sports, but also play and dance, which can foster inclusivity.

    <h1>Should adolescents start school later?</h1>
    <p>An adolescent’s body clock, or circadian rhythm, is generally set to a later schedule than that of older and younger people – teenagers’ bodies tell them to stay up later and get up later, too. This means it can be challenging when they need to perform academically in the early hours of the morning. Various pilot programs have found that later secondary school start times may help students get more sleep, feel less depressed, attend school more, and achieve higher grades. For example, when one school changed its start time from the already relatively late 8:50am to 10am, 12% more students made “good academic progress,” while the average number of student sick days dropped from 15 to 11.Yet chronotypes – our natural preferences around sleeping and waking patterns – differ between adolescents, just as they do between adults. Night owls prefer to sleep later, while morning larks like to go to sleep earlier. The teenagers most likely to underperform academically when school starts early are those predisposed to being night owls. Morning larks, on the other hand, tend to do best. Starting school later might therefore be helpful for night owls – but unhelpful, or even detrimental, for morning larks.</p>
